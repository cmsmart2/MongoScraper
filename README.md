Then click the Home button to see the lst of articles with the title, summary, and a link displayed on the Home page.

If you wish to save an article and make notes on it, click the "Save Article" below the article you wish to save.

The article is then moved from the Home page and moved to the Saved Articles page. Click on "Saved Articles" in the navigation bar. You will then see the list of saved articles, each with two buttons to "Add a Note" or "Remove from Saved Articles", which do exactly what they say.

To move an article out of this list, click the button that says "Remove from Saved Articles" and the article moves back to the Home page. (All notes are lost when the article is moved out of the Saved Articles list.)

A few other notes:

The site is mobile responsive, built with Bootstrap 4.0 and CSS with media queries.

Why the Project is Useful
The app fulfills a homework assignment for University of Kansas Coding Boot Camp, August 2019 to February 2020. Besides allowing me to continue working with Node.js and npm packages, the assignment also allowed me to work with express, express-handlebars, and MySQL.
